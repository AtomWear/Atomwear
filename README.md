*Atomwear is a micro, modularized, open source, wearable BLE device for DIYers. It makes any BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) projects easier.* 


## Overview - What’s the Atomwear? ##

- Atomwear is a BLE product based on a Nordic BLE chipset. It’s different from other wrist straps available in the market, such as gearfit and jawbone. 

- Atomwear is designed specifically for DIYers. just like building blocks for kids, Atomwear components allow you to build it into whatever you like, be it a bracelet or otherwise!

- Atomwear is fully open source. The aim of Atomwear is to speed up your development cycles, should you choose it to be the develop kit for you new BLE project.

## What can we do with the atomwear? ##

#### Pedometer and Motion tracker ####

Using acceleration sensor, combined with our pedometer algorithm, can easily realize step counting function, connect with your mobile phone via Bluetooth, check your movement data any time, share them with your friend via APP. 

####Temperature and Humidity detection ####

By using a Temperature & Humidity sensor, you can easily get the real-time information and display on OLED screen, you can also synchronize the data onto mobile APP via Bluetooth

#### Bluetooth intelligent anti-lost locator ####


 Through the distance changes to determine whether the items are controlled in your safe range, can be applied to the anti lost of mobile phone, anti lost wallet, keys, luggage and other valuables, also can be used to prevent children or pets lost. 

#### Pressure & Altitudedetection ####

You can measure the atmospheric pressure through the pressure sensor, calculate altitude value via pressure and temperature, provides a great convenience for travel or outdoor sports. 

#### E-Compass ####

With a high sensitivity magnetic field sensor and related algorithm, you can development the e-compass application easily. 

#### Gesture recognition ####

Gyroscope technology is becoming a new and high-profile somatosensory control technology, which can provide accurate inertial, reaction force, position, velocity and acceleration signal, using these data and accurate motion detection algorithm, bring new motion and gaming experience.

#### HID Input ####

Human interface device (HID) application mode in Bluetooth Technology can make you easily connect and control their computer, joystick, remote monitoring equipment etc.. 

#### Bluetooth Smart Beacon ####

Atomwear can be used as a Beacon Kit. The Beacon application lets you explore the full range of possibilities for beacons using Bluetooth® Smart technology. The application allows you register actions that will be triggered when specified event occur. Currently a beacon may silent the phone, open an application, open a website in a browser, show predefined information about an objector play an alarm on one of the 4 events: beacon region has been entered or exited, a beacon is near or very close. …… Use your imagination, you can do more than you can expected!
